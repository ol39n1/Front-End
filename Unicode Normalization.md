## Unicode normalization
is a critical but often overlooked aspect of text processing in modern applications. When handling international text, proper normalization ensures consistency, improves search functionality, and prevents hard-to-diagnose bugs. This guide explores what normalization is, why it matters, and how to implement it correctly in your applications.

## Why Unicode Normalization Is Needed

### The Problem of Equivalent Representations

In Unicode, certain characters can be represented in multiple ways, which creates ambiguity when comparing or processing text. For example, the character "é" (e with acute accent) can be represented as:

1. A single precomposed character: U+00E9 (é)
2. A sequence of base character plus combining mark: U+0065 (e) + U+0301 (´)

To the human eye, these representations appear identical when rendered, but to a computer, they are completely different code point sequences. This leads to several problems:

- **String comparison fails**: `"café" !== "cafe´"` despite visual equivalence
- **Search functionality breaks**: Searching for "café" won't find "cafe´"
- **Inconsistent data storage**: The same text might be stored differently at different times
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Attackers may use visual confusion to craft malicious URLs or input

### Common Scenarios Requiring Normalization

1. **User input handling**: Forms, search boxes, usernames
2. **Text comparison**: When comparing user input against stored values
3. **Database operations**: When storing and querying international text
4. **URL handling**: For internationalized domain names
5. **File operations**: When dealing with filenames containing non-ASCII characters

## Unicode Normalization Forms

Unicode defines four standard normalization forms, each serving different purposes:

### NFD (Normalization Form D - Canonical Decomposition)

NFD decomposes characters into their canonical constituents. Precomposed characters are broken down into their base character and combining marks.

Example:
- Input: "café" (with precomposed é)
- NFD output: "cafe´" (e + combining acute accent)

### NFC (Normalization Form C - Canonical Composition)

NFC first decomposes characters, then recomposes them by applying canonical composition. This is the most commonly used normalization form for web applications.

Example:
- Input: "cafe´" (e + combining acute accent)
- NFC output: "café" (with precomposed é)

### NFKD (Normalization Form KD - Compatibility Decomposition)

NFKD applies compatibility decomposition, which is more aggressive than canonical decomposition. It not only separates combining characters but also transforms compatibility characters to their equivalent forms.

Example:
- Input: "①" (circled digit one)
- NFKD output: "1" (ASCII digit one)

### NFKC (Normalization Form KC - Compatibility Composition)

NFKC first applies compatibility decomposition (like NFKD), then recomposes using canonical composition (like NFC).

Example:
- Input: "ｆｕｌｌ－ｗｉｄｔｈ" (full-width characters)
- NFKC output: "full-width" (ASCII characters)

## Choosing the Right Normalization Form

| Form | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| NFC  | General purpose, web applications, most user-facing applications. Best for storage and display. |
| NFD  | macOS file systems (macOS uses NFD internally), certain linguistic applications. |
| NFKC | Search indexing, case folding, removing distinctions that don't affect semantics. |
| NFKD | Temporary use for analysis, rarely for storage. |

## Implementing Normalization in JavaScript

JavaScript provides built-in support for Unicode normalization through the `String.prototype.normalize()` method, which is supported in all modern browsers and Node.js.

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Converting to NFC (the default normalization form)
const nfcString = "cafe\u0301".normalize(); // Default is "NFC"
console.log(nfcString); // "café"

// Explicitly specifying normalization forms
const nfdString = "café".normalize("NFD");
const nfkcString = "ｆｕｌｌ－ｗｉｄｔｈ".normalize("NFKC");
const nfkdString = "①".normalize("NFKD");

console.log(nfdString); // "cafe´" (visually the same but decomposed)
console.log(nfkcString); // "full-width"
console.log(nfkdString); // "1"
```

### Complete Example: User Input Normalization

```javascript
function processUserInput(input) {
  // Normalize to NFC for consistency
  const normalizedInput = input.normalize("NFC");
  
  // Now we can safely compare or store the normalized string
  return normalizedInput;
}

// Example usage
const userInput1 = "café"; // With precomposed character
const userInput2 = "cafe\u0301"; // With combining character

console.log(userInput1 === userInput2); // false - without normalization
console.log(
  processUserInput(userInput1) === processUserInput(userInput2)
); // true - after normalization
```

### Implementing a Search Function with Normalization

```javascript
function normalizedSearch(haystack, needle) {
  const normalizedHaystack = haystack.normalize("NFC").toLowerCase();
  const normalizedNeedle = needle.normalize("NFC").toLowerCase();
  
  return normalizedHaystack.includes(normalizedNeedle);
}

// Example usage
const text = "Résumé with café experience";
console.log(normalizedSearch(text, "café")); // true
console.log(normalizedSearch(text, "cafe\u0301")); // true
console.log(normalizedSearch(text, "resume")); // true
```

## Best Practices for Handling User Input with Composed Characters

### 1. Normalize Early, Compare Normalized

Normalize text as soon as it enters your application, then keep it normalized throughout the application lifecycle.

```javascript
// Form input handler example
document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const userInput = document.getElementById('userInput').value;
  const normalizedInput = userInput.normalize('NFC');
  
  // Process the normalized input...
  saveToDatabase(normalizedInput);
});
```

### 2. Be Consistent with Your Normalization Form

Choose one normalization form (typically NFC) and use it consistently throughout your application.

```javascript
// Define a utility function for application-wide use
function normalizeText(text) {
  // NFC is generally the best choice for web applications
  return text.normalize('NFC');
}

// Use this function everywhere text needs to be normalized
```

### 3. Remember to Normalize Both Sides When Comparing

When comparing user input against stored values, normalize both sides of the comparison.

```javascript
function checkPassword(inputPassword, storedPassword) {
  return normalizeText(inputPassword) === normalizeText(storedPassword);
}
```

### 4. Consider NFKC for Search Functionality

For search functionality, NFKC can provide better results by ignoring presentational differences.

```javascript
function prepareForSearch(text) {
  // Use NFKC for search indexing
  return text.normalize('NFKC').toLowerCase();
}

// Index building
const searchIndex = [];
for (const item of items) {
  searchIndex.push({
    original: item,
    searchable: prepareForSearch(item)
  });
}

// Search function
function search(query) {
  const normalizedQuery = prepareForSearch(query);
  return searchIndex.filter(item => item.searchable.includes(normalizedQuery))
    .map(item => item.original);
}
```

### 5. Handle Special Cases in URLs and Filenames

Be especially careful with URLs and filenames, as different operating systems handle normalization differently.

```javascript
function normalizeFileName(fileName) {
  // macOS uses NFD internally for filenames
  if (detectMacOS()) {
    return fileName.normalize('NFD');
  }
  // Windows and most Linux systems prefer NFC
  return fileName.normalize('NFC');
}
```

### 6. Implement Client-Side Validation with Normalization

When validating user input on the client side, apply normalization before validation.

```javascript
function validateUsername(username) {
  const normalized = username.normalize('NFC');
  
  // Check length after normalization
  if (normalized.length < 3 || normalized.length > 20) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Other validation rules...
  return /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/.test(normalized);
}
```

### 7. Consider Performance for Large Text Processing

For large text processing, be aware of performance implications. Consider normalizing in chunks or using Web Workers for client-side processing.

```javascript
function normalizeChunks(text, chunkSize = 10000) {
  const chunks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = text.slice(i, i + chunkSize).normalize('NFC');
    chunks.push(chunk);
  }
  return chunks.join('');
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Inconsistent Normalization

**Problem**: Different parts of your application use different normalization forms.

**Solution**: Create a centralized normalization utility that's used throughout your application.

### Pitfall 2: Length Calculations

**Problem**: Character count may change after normalization.

**Solution**: Always measure string length after normalization.

```javascript
function getCharCount(text) {
  return text.normalize('NFC').length;
}
```

### Pitfall 3: Database Collation Issues

**Problem**: Database collation settings might not match your normalization strategy.

**Solution**: Normalize before storing and after retrieving from the database.

### Pitfall 4: Regular Expression Matching

**Problem**: Regular expressions may not work as expected with unnormalized text.

**Solution**: Normalize text before applying regular expressions.

```javascript
function testRegex(regex, text) {
  return regex.test(text.normalize('NFC'));
}
```

## Conclusion

Unicode normalization is an essential component of robust text processing in applications that handle international text.
